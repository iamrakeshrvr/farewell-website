      <p>
        Hey Thangams,

        I’ve been thinking about how much you’ve grown and the incredible bonds you’ve made here in Kochi. It warms my heart to see how you’ve connected with wonderful people like Rahul bro, and I know leaving is bittersweet.

        As you head back to Chennai, where all your friends await, remember that you’re leaving behind not just a city, but a chapter filled with beautiful memories and friendships. I know it was tough saying goodbye, but I hope you leave with a smile, knowing you’ve touched so many lives here.

        And speaking of memories, I’ll never forget how we fell in love during your time in Kochi. Those moments we shared, the laughter, the adventures— they are etched in my heart forever. Kochi will always be special because it’s where our story began, and I’m grateful for every moment I had with you.

        You’ve built something truly special during your time in Kochi. You’ve made lifelong friends and unforgettable memories. As you embark on this new chapter, I want you to know how proud I am of you and how excited I am for everything that lies ahead.

        Here’s to new adventures, new challenges, and new beginnings in Chennai. May this next journey be filled with success, joy, and everything you’ve ever dreamed of.

        Wishing you all the best on your new adventure, Thangam. You’re going to do amazing things, and I am always with you.

        Love you always,
        
        Your love
      </p>
